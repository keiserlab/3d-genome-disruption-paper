# _In silico_ discovery of repetitive elements as key sequence determinants of 3D genome folding

## About 
We perform unbiased and targeted _in silico_ experiments with a deep learning model to uncover the sequence determinants of 3D genome folding.

## Highlights 
- Mass, unbiased screening with a convolutional neural network trained to predict Hi-C from sequence reveals sequences correlated with genome organization. Paired deletion and insertion experiments disentangle which sequence features are both necessary and sufficient for 3D genome folding. 
- Disruption is correlated with CTCF motif density and similarity, A compartments, regions with very high (>60%) and very low (<30%) GC content, and with highly active transcription surrounding the TSS. CTCF and CTCFL are the only transcription factor binding motifs robustly sufficient for disrupting genome folding.
- Disruption is correlated with clusters of repetitive elements (Alu, MIR) and RNAs (tRNA, snRNA) though many disruptive elements do not harbor CTCF motifs. Some repetitive elements are predicted to be sufficient for genome folding and act independently of CTCF and transcription. Repetitive element insertions cluster by family and have two primary phenotypes: (a) CTCF-like, boundary insertions and (b) star-like insertions.
